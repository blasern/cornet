# cornet: Correlation networks with R

Correlation networks based on a correlation threshold can easily be built using the `corrr` and `ggraph` packages. Unfortunately the use a p-value threshold was not as straightforward. This package makes it easy to create correlation networks based on either correlation thresholds or p-value thresholds.
